# Sparkle Update Automation for macOS Apps üöÄ

This repository contains **bash scripts** to automate the process of distributing **Sparkle** updates for macOS apps.  
With **App Center shutting down**, macOS developers need a streamlined way to **create, sign, notarize, and publish** Sparkle updates. These scripts use DropDMG, Amazon S3 and CloudFront to achieve that from a simple command.

These scripts handle:
- üì¶ **Creating a DMG** from your latest Xcode build
- üîè **Signing & notarizing** your app with Apple
- üìù **Generating `update.xml`** for Sparkle with changelogs
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Uploading the release** to Amazon S3 with CloudFront
- üöÄ **Invalidating caches** so users get the latest update instantly

For a detailed guide on setup and requirements, **read the blog post:**
